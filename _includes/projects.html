    <h3> Machine Learning Program </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Used to predict the survival of Titanic Passengers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I implemented a decision tree algorithm in order to predict which pasengers on the Titanic survived. I used different traits of each passenger such as their age, sex, and their number of siblings to determine whether or not they survived.</p>

    <h3> Machine Learning Program</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> My team made a machine learning program that can recognize handwriting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We uploaded our dataset to Lobe so that it could train a model for us to use. We then exported that model as a tensorflow model and eventually mounted the model onto a web page that utilized our laptop's webcam to get input. </p>
